\section*{Problem 1}
Assume that you have a data set with a predictor (feature) $X$ and the target $Y$. You run simple linear regression ($Y ~ X$) and get the best fit with RSS=20 and TSS=120.\\

\textbf{1. What is the covariance between X and Y if the variances of X and Y are Var(X)=15 and Var(Y)=20?}
\paragraph*{}The \textit{covariance} between variables $X$ and $Y$ is defined by:
\begin{equation}
\label{covar}
Cov(X,Y) = E[XY] + E[X]E[Y]
\end{equation}

\textbf{2. Repeat if RSS=50 and TSS=40. Discuss the result.}

\section*{Problem 3}

\textbf{1. Do you expect random forests to achieve a smaller or larger training error than bagged trees with the same number of trees? Justify your answer.}


\textbf{2. How would you expect the training error of bagged trees to compare with boosted trees? Justify your answer.}


\textbf{3. How would you decide how many trees to use for any particular data set in a random forest? It is best to choose the number that minimizes the training error? Why or why not?}

\section*{Problem 4}
This problem examines the differences between SVC (linear SVM), SVM with a polynomial kernel, and other linear classifiers. \\

\textbf{1. For an arbitrary training set, would you expect for SVC (linear) or SVM (polynomial kernel) to work better on the training set? Why?}


\textbf{2. If the Bayes decision boundary between the two classes is linear, would you expect SVC or SVM to work better on the training set?}


\textbf{3. True or False: There is no need to use slack variables in SVMs with polynomial kernels because the decision boundary can be nonlinear. Justify your answer.}


\textbf{4. LDA, Logistic regression, and SVC (linear) all fit a linear decision boundary. Will their fits be the same? What would be some reasons for you to prefer LDA over SVC?}
